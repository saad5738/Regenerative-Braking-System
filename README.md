# Regenerative-Breaking-System
This projects helps to achieve adaptive regeneration in EV's to maximize energy recovery and prevent the safety risks

We have two sketches for two arduino uno boards 

Board 1 will detect the state of vehicle and transmit it to Board2
1)Coasting
2)Cornering
3)Downhill

Board2 will process the data recieved and latch the relay accordingly to complete the resistive network
and achieve of Regen
1)Aggressive mode
2)Mild mode

A Brake light will be triggered if the vehicle is under aggressive regenration 

Components Used
2-Uno boards
Resistors
Motors
Relays
